We could use `alias` for shorter command (For UNIX systems)

For example, we can type 

```bash
alias nrb="npm run build"
```

instead type all `npm run build`

On the Window platform, we can use `doskey`

```bash
doskey nrs=npm run start
```

it have similar functionality as the above
