# Call stack 

1. Primarily use for function invocation(call);
2. It’s synchronous ,from top to bottom;
3. It’s a data structure that uses the **Last In First Out** principle
   - It’s mean the first function invocation is added first and stay at bottom, last function invocation is pushed on the top of the first functions and the latest function invocations is put  on the most top of the stack;
   - And the most top function will be the first function that was invoked and when it was finished , the stack clears it and so on .
4. Single-threaded means It can only do one thing at a time.
