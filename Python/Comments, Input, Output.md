# Comment, User input and output



- ##### **Print**
  
  In python 3, print method works with parentheses like:
  
  ```python
  print("Hello World!")
  ```
  
  


- ##### Comment

  In python, to comment a section, we use ‘#’ character on each line we want to comment :

  ```python
  # First 
  print('second')
  # Here is
  # nothing
  ```

  And we can use triple double quotes to make a multiline comment:

  ```python
  """
  Here is a 
  multiline comment
  """
  ```

  

- ##### Custom ending values of print function

  We can add a value to the end position of returned value from  __print__ method by add an _`end_ ` parameter:

  ```python
  print('Hello ', end='World!')
  ```

  In case of default,  end parameter is new line character, so if we don’t want to have new line, we put `end=‘ ’`

  

- ##### Get user input

  To get the user input, use **input** function:

  ```python
  name = Loc
  age = input(f'What\'s the age of the men named {name}') 
  # What's the age of the men named Loc
  ```

  

- ##### Change input prompt symbol

  ```python
  prompt = '>'
  input(prompt)
  # >....
  ```
