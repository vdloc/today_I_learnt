# Variable Assignment

- ##### Unpack the values
  
  In python we can unpack the values from an object like destructuring in ES6
  
  ```python
  foo = [1, 2, 3]
  first, second, third = foo
  print(second) # 2
  ```
  
- ##### Mutiple assignment

  We can assign multiple values to multiple variables in a single line:

  ```python
  a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
  print(a)  # 1
  print(b) # 2
  print(c) # 3
  ```
