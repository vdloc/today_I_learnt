# Here is a summary of the key information from the redux-saga API reference

- Provides effects like `take`, `put`, `call`, `fork` to help manage side effects and async logic in Redux.

- `take` allows sagas to **wait** for actions dispatched to the store. `put` allows **dispatching** actions.

- `call` and `fork` are used to invoke functions in a **blocking** or **non-blocking** way.

- Sagas use Generators to make asynchronous flows easy to read and write.

- Middlewares handle running sagas and linking them to the Redux store.

- `Channels` and `buffers` allow sending messages between sagas.

- `race`, `all`, and other effect combinators allow **controlling concurrency**.

- Monitoring and error handling with try/catch supported.

- Utils like buffers, eventChannel helper functions provided.

- Testability features like cloneableGenerator and mocked task.

In summary, redux-saga provides an ergonomic way to organize complex async Redux app logic using familiar syntax like try/catch and Generators.
